###WDI-HW Submission

######Description

- Cool.io is a way to visualize a user's friends past Facebook interaction in order to give them an overall ranking related to their posts, and how much their friends interact with their posts/profile.  

######Plans for the Future

- Currently a user can sign-up/login with Facebook and can view all of their friends.  In the near future Cool.io would like to implement features for viewing friend interaction statistics and taking action based upon this information.

######Technologies Implemented

- Rails/Active Record/PostgreSQL
- Backbone.js, D3.js
- Redis/resque
